### Transfer baud rate

The default value of 115200 Baud is supported by all MCU starting with
the STC15 family, and at least the STC12C5A56S2 before that. For older
MCU, you might have to use ```-b 19200``` for correct operation.

### Protocols

STC MCUs use a variety of related but incompatible protocols for the
BSL. The protocol can be specified with the ```-P``` flag. By default
UART protocol autodetection is used. The mapping between protocols
and MCU series is as follows:

* ```auto``` Automatic detection of UART based protocols (default)
* ```stc89``` STC89/90 series
* ```stc89a``` STC89/90 series (BSL 7.2.5C)
* ```stc12a``` STC12x052 series and possibly others
* ```stc12b``` STC12x52 series, STC12x56 series and possibly others
* ```stc12``` Most STC10/11/12 series
* ```stc15a``` STC15x104E and STC15x204E(A) series
* ```stc15``` Most STC15 series
* ```stc8``` STC8A8K64S4A12 and STC8F series
* ```stc8d``` All STC8 and STC32 series
* ```stc8g``` STC8G1 and STC8H1 series
* ```usb15``` USB support on STC15W4 series

The text files in the doc/reverse-engineering subdirectory provide an
overview over the reverse engineered protocols used by the BSLs. For
more details, please read the source code.

### Getting MCU information

Call stcgal without any file to program. It will dump information
about the MCU, e.g.:

```
$ ./stcgal.py -P stc15
Waiting for MCU, please cycle power: done
Target model:
  Name: IAP15F2K61S2
  Magic: F449
  Code flash: 61.0 KB
  EEPROM flash: 0.0 KB
Target frequency: 10.046 MHz
Target BSL version: 7.1S
Target wakeup frequency: 34.771 KHz
Target options:
  reset_pin_enabled=False
  clock_source=internal
  clock_gain=high
  watchdog_por_enabled=False
  watchdog_stop_idle=True
  watchdog_prescale=256
  low_voltage_reset=True
  low_voltage_threshold=3
  eeprom_lvd_inhibit=True
  eeprom_erase_enabled=False
  bsl_pindetect_enabled=False
  por_reset_delay=long
  rstout_por_state=high
  uart2_passthrough=False
  uart2_pin_mode=normal
Disconnected!
```

If the identification fails, see the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for troubleshooting.

### Program the flash memory

stcgal supports Intel HEX encoded files as well as binary files. Intel
HEX is autodetected by file extension (.hex, .ihx or .ihex).

Call stcgal just like before, but provide the path to the code image:

```
$ ./stcgal.py -P stc15 hello.hex
Waiting for MCU, please cycle power: done
Target model:
  Name: IAP15F2K61S2
  Magic: F449
  Code flash: 61.0 KB
  EEPROM flash: 0.0 KB
Target frequency: 10.046 MHz
Target BSL version: 7.1S
Target wakeup frequency: 34.771 KHz
Target options:
  reset_pin_enabled=False
  clock_source=internal
  clock_gain=high
  watchdog_por_enabled=False
  watchdog_stop_idle=True
  watchdog_prescale=256
  low_voltage_reset=True
  low_voltage_threshold=3
  eeprom_lvd_inhibit=True
  eeprom_erase_enabled=False
  bsl_pindetect_enabled=False
  por_reset_delay=long
  rstout_por_state=high
  uart2_passthrough=False
  uart2_pin_mode=normal
Loading flash: 80 bytes (Intel HEX)
Trimming frequency: 10.046 MHz
Switching to 19200 baud: done
Erasing flash: done
Writing 256 bytes: .... done
Setting options: done
Target UID: 0D000021022632
Disconnected!
```

You can also program the EEPROM part of the memory, if applicable. Add
the EEPROM image path to the commandline after the flash image path.

stcgal uses a conservative baud rate of 19200 bps by
default. Programming can be sped up by choosing a faster baud rate
with the flag ```-b```.

### Device options

stcgal dumps a number of target options. These can be modified as
well. Provide one (or more) ```-o``` flags followed by a key-value
pair on the commandline to adjust these settings. For instance, you can
enable the external crystal as clock source:

```
$ ./stcgal.py -P stc15 -o clock_source=external hello.bin
```

Please note that device options can only be set when flash memory is
programmed!

### Frequency trimming

If the internal RC oscillator is used (```clock_source=internal```),
stcgal can execute a trim procedure to adjust it to a given value. This
is only supported by STC15 series and newer. The trim values are stored
with device options. Use the ```-t``` flag to request trimming to a certain
value. Generally, frequencies between 4000 and 30000 kHz can be achieved.
If trimming fails, stcgal will abort.

### Automatic power-cycling

STC's microcontrollers require a power-on reset to invoke the bootloader,
which can be inconvenient. stcgal can use the DTR control signal of a
serial interface to automate this. The DTR signal is asserted for
approximately 500 ms when the autoreset feature is enabled with the
```-a``` flag. This requires external circuitry to actually switch the
power. In some cases, when the microcontroller draws only little power,
it is possible to directly supply power from the DTR signal.

As an alternative to DTR, you can use a custom shell command or an external
script (via -r option) to reset the  device. You should specify the command
along with -a option. Do not forget the quotes!

Example:

```
  $ ./stcgal.py -P stc15 -a -r "echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio666/value"
```
or

```
  $ ./stcgal.py -P stc15 -a -r "./powercycle.sh"
```

### Exit status

The exit status is 0 if no error occured while executing stcgal. Any
error, such as a protocol error or I/O error, results in an exit
status of 1. If the the user aborted stcgal by pressing CTRL-C,
that results in an exit status of 2.

### USB support

STC15W4 series have an USB-based BSL that can be optionally
used. USB support in stcgal is experimental and might change in the
future. USB mode is enabled by using the ```usb15``` protocol. The
port (```-p```) flag as well as the baudrate options are ignored for
the USB protocol. RC frequency trimming is not supported.
